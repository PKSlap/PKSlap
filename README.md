- Hi, I’m @PKSlap

- My background is in doing quality control testing as a chemist in the dietary supplements industry. I've learned how to use Excel sheets to automate calculations and hope to learn how to validate code to comply with FDA requirements.
- I’m interested in web and game development and want to make a browser-based or app-based RPG as a personal project. I like using open-source applications and would like learn enough to reach a point where I can contribute.
- I’m currently learning javascript as a while brushing up on HTML/CSS that I haven't used since playing NeoPets.
  - Afterwards, I'm thinking about picking up VBA to develop my own tools rather than be limited to what's built-in by Microsoft Excel.
